# BMI Calculator with local persistence

A Santander Bootcamp challenge where we have to built a BMI Calculator with Dart and Flutter local persistence. In this project we have to collect the height and weight value, calculate, and return the BMI result in another page. In this page, the user decide if they want to save result in a list or re-calculate. The user can delete items from this list, and it must persist locally even after the application is closed.

Note: I incremented some pages (with functionality to implement).
